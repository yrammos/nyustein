My custom LaTeX class for hands-free typesetting according to the [NYU Doctoral Handbook](http://steinhardt.nyu.edu/scmsAdmin/uploads/002/088/doctoral%20handbook%200809.pdf). Based on the [memoir](http://www.ctan.org/pkg/memoir) package.

Class customizations are currently only possible by hard-coding into the `.cls`. Future releases, especially if public, may add support for `\documentclass` options.

This class may be released to the public domain at some point, but not yet.
